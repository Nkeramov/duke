## Description

This program draws the sequence of images, creating the illusion of motion, where the Java mascot Duke cart-wheels across the screen.

This project is an updated version of an old program that was introduced in the first version of Java as an illustration of the graphics and possibilities of dynamic interactive content in web documents. In that program  Duke turned a wheel around the screen. Everyone liked the funny cartoon creature, and because already introduced the official logo of the Java programming language in the form of a cup of coffee, Duke became the official mascot of the Java language.

The old version used GIF files, which can also be found in the project files. To create animation in this version used jpegs that obtained from gifs by increasing the resolution through a neural network.
